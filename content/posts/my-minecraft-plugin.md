So a few days ago i got the idea of listening to music while playing Minecraft but instead of doing that with Spotify why can't I just play my SMP and if I discover a Music Disc get that added to a library I can access at all times.

So right now I'm programming that as a Bukkit Plugin. You can check the project out on GitHub: https://github.com/iamgabrieltv/mobile-jukebox
